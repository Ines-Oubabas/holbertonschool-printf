# Printf Project

## Description

This project implements a simplified version of the printf function in C. It supports various conversion specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, and `%%`.

## How to Use

. Include the header file `main.h` in your code.

```c
#include "main.h"


Certainly! Below is a detailed README template for your C project implementing _printf:

# Printf Project

## Description

This project implements a simplified version of the printf function in C. It supports various conversion specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, and `%%`.

## How to Use

1. Include the header file `holberton.h` in your code.

#include "main.h"
```
Compile your code with the source files _printf.c, handle_char.c, handle_string.c, and _putchar.c.
```c
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format _printf.c handle_char.c handle_string.c _putchar.c your_code.c -o your_executable
```
Use the _printf function in your code.
```c
int main(void) {
    _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "World");
    return (0);
}
```
Compile and run your program.
```c
./your_executable
```
## Supported Conversion Specifiers

%c : Character

%s : String

%% : Print a percentage

## Additional Notes
- The files _printf.c, handle_char.c, handle_string.c, and _putchar.c must be included in the compilation process.
- Ensure to include holberton.h in your source files where you use the _printf function.
- You can add new conversion specifiers as needed.
- For more information on using the _printf function, refer to the standard documentation for the printf function in the C language.

```c
Feel free to customize this README based on specific details of your project. Include information on compilation, usage of the `_printf` function, and any other relevant details for users of your code.
